# notepad-dark-build
Source code for original build of Notepad Dark.

This is the first build, a clone of the popular Windows text editor NotePad with some additional features.

The basic functionality of this program is identical to Windows NotePad but with some extra features like the ability to toggle between light and dark mode and the ability to create short notes on a sticky pad and stick it to the main NotePad Dark window.

This program was written primarily in Java and packaged using Gradle.
